Subject: Request to delink my Aadhaar Number & irrevocably purge all
Aadhaar-related information

Dear Manager,

I hold a savings/current bank account at your financial institution.

Based on your repeated compulsions, and in adherence to the government
guidelines that were referred by you, I had submitted my Aadhaar details to
you, to sign up for and/or to continue using your services without interruption.

As you may be aware, the law which enabled you to demand my Aadhaar details was
challenged in the Supreme Court of India, and the highest court has now
given its verdict.

On September 27th 2018, the Supreme Court of India declared that Aadhaar cannot
be used by private entities and any such access, use or storage of Aadhaar
details will be held in violation of the Fundamental Rights.

As your customer, I don't want you to push the Government of India to try and
bring another law to enable linking of Aadhaar with private entities. The said
linking has been rightly held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court and any
attempts to change that will only show you in bad light.

In exercising my fundamental rights and in accordance to Aadhaar
(Authentication)
Regulations 2006, Section 16(5) , I demand that you immediately take the
following actions:

1.  Delink my Aadhaar identifier from all your systems,

2.  Irrecoverably purge my Aadhaar related information from all your systems,

3.  Irrecoverably purge any record, older than six months, that contains my
Aadhaar related information,

4.  Ensure irrecoverable purging of my Aadhaar related information from any
third parties, to whom you have shared my information, including any records
that are six months or more older,

5.  Implement all necessary steps to guarantee that no Aadhaar number
(including a number submitted by someone else) gets linked to my phone number
without explicit written consent from me,

6.  Complete all the requirements under Aadhaar (Authentication) Regulations
2016, Sections (6), (7) and (8),

7.  Confirm your complete addressal and completion of my above requests (1-6)
within a period of 15 days from today.

Please acknowledge your receipt of this email requesting delinking and deletion
of Aadhaar information through email or registered post.

Do note that if you fail to comply with my above requests during this period
without my written consent, you shall be liable for any damages, data leaks or
misuse of my identity information under relevant sections
of Information Technology Act, 2000 and various other provisions as applicable,
without prejudice to any other cause that may be applicable in this respect.
