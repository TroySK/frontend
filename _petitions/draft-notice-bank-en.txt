Subject: Request to delink my Aadhaar Number & irrevocably purge all
      Aadhaar-related information

Dear Manager,

I hold a savings/current bank account at your financial institution.

Based on your repeated compulsions, and respecting the government
guidelines to which had been referred, I had submitted my Aadhaar details
to you for which to sign up, and/or, to continue to use your services without
interruption.

As you may be aware, the law that enabled you to demand my Aadhaar details
was challenged in the Supreme Court of India, and the highest court
has given its verdict.

On September 27th 2018, the Supreme Court of India declared that
Aadhaar cannot be used by private entities and any such access,
use or storage of Aadhaar details will be held in violation of the
Fundamental Rights enshrined in the Constitution.

In exercising my fundamental rights, and according to Aadhaar
(Authentication) Regulations 2016, Section 16(5) ,
I demand that you immediately take the following actions:

1.  Delink my Aadhaar identifier from all your systems,

2.  Irrecoverably purge my Aadhaar related information from all
    your systems,

3.  Irrecoverably purge any record, older than six months, which contain my
    Aadhaar related information,

4.  Ensure irrecoverable purging of my Aadhaar related information with
    any third parties, to whom you have shared my information, including
    any records that are six months or more older,

5.  Implement all necessary steps to guarantee that no Aadhaar number
    (including any number submitted by someone else) gets linked to my
    account without explicit written consent from me,

6.  Complete all the requirements under Aadhaar (Authentication) Regulations
    2016, Sections (6), (7) and (8),

7.  Confirm your complete addressal and completion of my above requests
    (1-6) within a period of 15 days from today.

Please acknowledge your receipt of this email requesting delinking
and deletion of Aadhaar information through email or registered post.

Do note that if you fail to comply with my above requests during
this period without my written consent, you shall be liable for any damages,
data leaks or misuse of my identity information under relevant sections of
Information Technology Act, 2000 and various other provisions as applicable,
without prejudice to any other cause that may be applicable.
